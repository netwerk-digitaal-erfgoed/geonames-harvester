# Geonames-harvest

Simple download and transform scripts to download and convert geonames dumps into a basic RDF dataset. The result is loaded in a SPARQL endpoint for querying the data through the Network-of-Terms.

## Installation

### RML

The text to RDF transformation is done using [SPARQL Anything](https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything).
This requires a Java runtime environment.
You can download the SPARQL Anything JAR [here](https://github.com/SPARQL-Anything/sparql.anything/releases).

### Fuseki

The Geonames RDF is exposed through a Jena Fuseki based SPARQL endpoint. In this setup is choosen for the Fuseki docker server without UI. Download and extract the latest version of [the Jena Fuseki Docker](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/jena/jena-fuseki-docker/) zipfile and rename the new directory to `./fuseki`. Build the docker image using `docker-compose build --build-arg JENA_VERSION={latest version}`. Be sure to use a recent docker-compose version! Create an empty 'databases' and 'logs' dir before the first run. See the [Fuseki docs](https://jena.apache.org/documentation/fuseki2/fuseki-docker.html) for more information.

Afther cloning the repo and installing the additional tools described above, the subdirectories will look like this:

## Geonames download scripts

A number of `bash` scripts take care of the download, mapping and exposing the generated RDF through a SPARQL endpoint.  

These script also requires the `sed` en `awk` tools for preprocessing. These are avaible in standard Linux distro's.

See the [Geonames download website](https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/) for detailed information on the geonames dumpfiles.

Run the scripts in the following order:

1. **Download**
Run the `download.sh` to download the data. After downloading some basic cleanup is done to prevent problems in the mapping proces. The download files are placed in the `./data` directory.

2. **Mapping**
   Run the `map.sh` to convert the text files to RDF. This produces a `data/geonames.ttl` file. 

3. **Expose the data**
   Run the `server.sh` to start the server and expose the SPARQL-endpoint on <http://localhost:3030/geonames/sparql>.
